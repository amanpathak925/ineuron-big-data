1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

hadoop fs -put /users/asus/downloads/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive/assignments/

3. Create a database hiveassignments

create database hiveassignments;
use hiveassignments;

4. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

create table sales_order_csv

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

select year, month from 
(select year_id as year, month_id as month, sum(quantityordered) as total_quantity, dense_rank() over(partition by year_id order by sum(quantityordered) desc) as r
